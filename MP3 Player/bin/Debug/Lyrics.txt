I'm not tryna complicate none of this
None of this, so
Lemme just, lemme just, lemme just
Come tell you how I feel
Okay, uhm

I'm just lookin' for some balance and some trust
I'm just lookin' for some mutual love
But all I get is unrequited
Why my world always on fire, never chilly?
I used to hate the serious, I used to be so silly

But I'm not a kid no more
No, I'm not a kid
But I guess that's what we always said
Yeah, I guess that's what we always said, hey

And we can get lost in an off-beat rhythm
Feel the way that you're movin'
And I think that I get it
And I think that I will

'Til the sun come up
When the sun go down
We gon' get in touch

'Cause I don't even know
I don't know why
All your love I'm tryna find
I'm so lost in you
And all that you do, hey

And here we go, I
Never really know why
I'm just tryna take it slow
See where it goes

'Cause you know, that you'll never really know
Even though I can feel it in my soul
But you never know why

And here we go, I
Never really know why
I can't let it go
But you give me so much hope

So I gotta keep you close
Yeah, you're givin' the most
And I never know
No, I never know why

All the silly things we hide
Just to keep our peace of mind
No, I never know
No, I never know
No, I never know why

When you get older, plainer, saner
Will you remember all the danger
We came from?
Burning like embers, falling, tender
Longing for the days of no surrender
Years ago
And will you know

So smoke 'em if you got 'em
'Cause it's going down
All I ever wanted was you
I'll never get to heaven
'Cause I don't know how

Let's raise a glass or two
To all the things I've lost on you
Oh-oh
Tell me are they lost on you?
Oh-oh
Just that you could cut me loose
Oh-oh
After everything I've lost on you
Is that lost on you?

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Is that lost on you?
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Baby, is that lost on you?
Is that lost on you?

Wish that I could see the machinations
Understand the toil of expectations
In your mind
Hold me like you never lost your patience
Tell me that you love me more than hate me
All the time
And you're still mine

So smoke 'em if you got 'em
'Cause it's going down
All I ever wanted was you
Let's take a drink of heaven
This can turn around

Let's raise a glass or two
To all the things I've lost on you
Oh-oh
Tell me are they lost on you?
Oh-oh
Just that you could cut me loose
Oh-oh
After everything I've lost on you
Is that lost on you?

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Is that lost on you?
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Baby, is that lost on you?
Is that lost on you?

Let's raise a glass or two
To all the things I've lost on you
Oh-oh
Tell me are they lost on you?
Oh-oh
Just that you could cut me loose
Oh-oh
After everything I've lost on you
Is that lost on you?
Is that lost on you?

So slowly a sunlit dream pulls me out of sleep
Feel the morning through the blinds
I get to thinking bout your sunkissed face
And a quiet place where I could give you all my time

You know I wanna be your rock, my love
You know I wanna be your light
In darkness how you find me just in time
To tell me what I needed to hear
So if you don't know what you need
You can leave it all to me
Don't want you worried 'bout a thing
I know you'd do the same for me

Cuz' you're so lovely
You're so lovely
I can't help but fall for you, love
When you love me
It's so lovely loving you
So lovely loving you

So softly a tender breeze brush against my knees on a summer afternoon
I get to thinking bout' the hazy days under August shade that I used to spend with you
I didn't realize it was all I wanted, what I had
My riddled heart I had to cradle back together just to see
It's all like magic to me
You do magic, baby

When you love me
You're so lovely
I can't help but fall for you, love
When you love me
It's so lovely loving you
So lovely loving you

So slowly a sunlit dream pulls me out of sleep
Feel the morning through the blinds
I turn my head to meet your sunkissed face
In this quiet place I can give you all my time
