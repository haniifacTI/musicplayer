[Lost in You]
I'm not tryna complicate none of this
None of this, so
Lemme just, lemme just, lemme just
Come tell you how I feel
Okay, uhm

I'm just lookin' for some balance and some trust
I'm just lookin' for some mutual love
But all I get is unrequited
Why my world always on fire, never chilly?
I used to hate the serious, I used to be so silly

But I'm not a kid no more
No, I'm not a kid
But I guess that's what we always said
Yeah, I guess that's what we always said, hey

And we can get lost in an off-beat rhythm
Feel the way that you're movin'
And I think that I get it
And I think that I will

'Til the sun come up
When the sun go down
We gon' get in touch

'Cause I don't even know
I don't know why
All your love I'm tryna find
I'm so lost in you
And all that you do, hey

And here we go, I
Never really know why
I'm just tryna take it slow
See where it goes

'Cause you know, that you'll never really know
Even though I can feel it in my soul
But you never know why

And here we go, I
Never really know why
I can't let it go
But you give me so much hope

So I gotta keep you close
Yeah, you're givin' the most
And I never know
No, I never know why

All the silly things we hide
Just to keep our peace of mind
No, I never know
No, I never know
No, I never know why


[Tatsuro Yamashita - Magic Ways]
==Intro==
Oooh (Magic, magic, magic)
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh (Magic, magic, magic, magic)
I love the girl with magic ways

==Verse 1==
The way you whisper in my ear
To make my troubles disappear
It's magic
The way your little fingertips
Make my heart do double flips
It's magic

==Verse 2==
And when you smile at me that way
Well, you can warm the coldest day
It's magic
(It's magic, magic)
And even when you're gone I find
I hear you laughing in my mind
It's magic
(It's magic, magic)

==Pre-Chorus 1==
And all I have to do is think of you
To make the music start to play
Then I dance down the street
And the people I meet stop and say "Hey, hey"

==Chorus==
Magic ways, my friend (Ooh-ooh)
You love the girl with magic ways, and it's true
I might as well give in (Ooh-ooh)
You cast a spell on all my nights and days
With your sweet magic ways

==Verse 3==
When I go to sleep it seems
You sprinkle stardust in my dreams
It's magic
(It's magic, magic)
And in the morning when I rise
The mockingbirds all harmonize
It's magic
(It's magic, magic)

==Pre-Chorus 2==
And when you want me you just clap your hands
And I'll be with you right away
Then we'll float on a breeze
While the leaves in the trees softly say "Hey, hey"

==Chorus==
Magic ways, my friend (Ooh-ooh)
You love the girl with magic ways, and it's true
I might as well give in (Ooh-ooh)
You cast a spell on all my nights and days
With your sweet magic ways

==Bridge==
(Magic, magic, magic, magic
Uh-ah, ooh-oh
Magic, magic, magic, magic
Uh-ah, ooh-oh)

==Chorus==
Magic ways, my friend (Ooh-ooh)
You love the girl with magic ways, and it's true
I might as well give in (Ooh-ooh)
I love the girl with magic ways (I love the girl with magic)
Hey, Hey (I love the girl with magic ways)

==Outro==
Magic ways, my friend (Ooh-ooh)
You love the girl with magic ways, and it's true (Magic, magic)
I might as well give in
You cast a spell on all my nights and days
With your sweet magic-

Ways My friend (Ooh-ooh)
You love the girl with magic ways, and it's true (Magic, magic)
I might as well give in (Ooh-ooh)
I love the girl with magic ways (I love the girl with magic)
Ahhh (I love the girl with magic ways)

Magic ways my friend (Ooh-ooh)
You love the girl with magic ways, and it's true (Magic, magic)
I might as well give in
You cast a spell on all my nights and days


[LP - Lost On You (Official Audio)]
When you get older, plainer, saner
Will you remember all the danger
We came from?
Burning like embers, falling, tender
Longing for the days of no surrender
Years ago
And will you know

So smoke 'em if you got 'em
'Cause it's going down
All I ever wanted was you
I'll never get to heaven
'Cause I don't know how

Let's raise a glass or two
To all the things I've lost on you
Oh-oh
Tell me are they lost on you?
Oh-oh
Just that you could cut me loose
Oh-oh
After everything I've lost on you
Is that lost on you?

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Is that lost on you?
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Baby, is that lost on you?
Is that lost on you?

Wish that I could see the machinations
Understand the toil of expectations
In your mind
Hold me like you never lost your patience
Tell me that you love me more than hate me
All the time
And you're still mine

So smoke 'em if you got 'em
'Cause it's going down
All I ever wanted was you
Let's take a drink of heaven
This can turn around

Let's raise a glass or two
To all the things I've lost on you
Oh-oh
Tell me are they lost on you?
Oh-oh
Just that you could cut me loose
Oh-oh
After everything I've lost on you
Is that lost on you?

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Is that lost on you?
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Baby, is that lost on you?
Is that lost on you?

Let's raise a glass or two
To all the things I've lost on you
Oh-oh
Tell me are they lost on you?
Oh-oh
Just that you could cut me loose
Oh-oh
After everything I've lost on you
Is that lost on you?
Is that lost on you?
